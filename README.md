# report_card_template

Personal Report card for my abroad semester.\
![](example.png)\
The template is made for the courses that I follow. Thus, it probably isn't suited for everybody, but don't worry.

The class takes in a course as an option to have a `themecolor` for all elements in the document.\
You can change the available options if you want : https://github.com/avivi55/report_card_template/blob/99fce44c226b8994348b2b45922f88f1b64f2ad0/agh_report_card.cls#L7-L20

And the full name of the course: https://github.com/avivi55/report_card_template/blob/99fce44c226b8994348b2b45922f88f1b64f2ad0/agh_report_card.cls#L29-L48
